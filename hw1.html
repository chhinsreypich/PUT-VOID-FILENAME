        <p>
          This week I am extremely excited about a new cooking technique called <i>sous vide</i>. In <i>sous vide</i> cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that i s precisely set to the target temerapture you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <i>Cooking for Geeks</i>, Jeff Potter describes it as &#34; ultra-low-temperature poaching &#34;.

        <p>
          Next month, we will be serving <b><i>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</i></b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30
